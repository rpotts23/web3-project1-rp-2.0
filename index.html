                <p>Depth of Field can be tricky sometimes, but with proper instruction it can be a fun tool, as well as, create an amazing effect. Not only can this be used for photographing people, but it creates a smoky effect when used with landscape pictures.</p>

                <p>Of all the pictures in the world, some of the most amazing are those taken of natural forces. The earth is made up of many wonders: waterfalls, forests, mountains, and the list goes on. For these, learning shutter speed is crucial in capturing all the raw beauty.</p>

                <img src="images/forest1.png" />
                <p>The Sun shines and warms up the earth, besides that it makes plants grow. But when it is notaced most is when it is right in one’s eye or finally comes out after a thunderstorm. Lighting in photography is everything and effects everything that goes on.</p>
